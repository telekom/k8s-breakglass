                        Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                        Valid operators are Exists, Equal, Lt, and Gt. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.
                        Lt and Gt perform numeric comparisons (requires feature gate TaintTolerationComparisonOperators).

                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:

                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                            We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                            nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                            e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.

                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                                      between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                      The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                      or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                      In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                      |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                      - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                      scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                      violate MaxSkew(1).
                                      - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.

                                      Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                      And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                      this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                      As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                      scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                      If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                      Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                      When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                      The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                      In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                      because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                      it will violate MaxSkew.

                                      We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                      Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                      nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                      e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                                      And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.
                                      It's a required field.

                                      WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                                      the spread constraint.
                                      - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                      - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                        but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                        skew.
                                      A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                      if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                      "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                      If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                      to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                      MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                      won't make it *more* imbalanced.
                                      It's a required field.
