                  allowIDPMismatch indicates that this session should accept authorization requests from any IDP.
                  Set to true when both the cluster and escalation do NOT specify IDP requirements.
                  When false (default), the webhook will enforce that the requesting user's IDP matches
                  the IDP that created the session (via identityProviderIssuer matching).
                  This allows gradual migration to multi-IDP mode: sessions created before IDP tracking
                  can continue to work with any IDP until explicitly migrated.
